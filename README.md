# Traffic Junction Modeller Website

A website for presenting the CS261 - Software Engineering group project, where we model a single traffic junction.

## Prerequisites

As with the main project, these are the tools used for deploying the site. If you want to work on the site, then it's imperative to use the same tooling for consistency:

- [Bundler version 2.6.1](https://bundler.io/)
- [Ruby version 3.3.6](https://rubyinstaller.org/) 

## How to Locally Test

To test changes locally, we use bundler:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## How to Make Changes

Just commit and push to the `main` branch; you can view if there are any build errors on the GitHub repository.
